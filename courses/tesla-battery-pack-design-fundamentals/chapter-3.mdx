- Learn Tesla's cooling architecture and strategies
- Explore thermal modeling and simulation approaches
- Review real-world thermal performance data

## Why Thermal Management Matters

Battery performance, safety, and longevity are all directly tied to temperature. At Tesla, we've designed sophisticated thermal management systems that keep cells in their optimal operating range across all conditions - from Norwegian winters to Death Valley summers.

**Key Temperature Targets:**
- **Optimal Range**: 15-35°C for best performance and longevity
- **Operating Range**: -20°C to 60°C
- **Charging Range**: 0-45°C (with preconditioning)
- **Critical Limit**: <60°C to prevent thermal runaway
