**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand structural design requirements for battery packs
- Learn about crash safety and protection strategies
- Explore mounting systems and vehicle integration
- Review mechanical testing and validation procedures

## Introduction

The mechanical design of Tesla battery packs must satisfy multiple competing requirements: lightweight for efficiency, strong for safety, manufacturable for cost, and serviceable for maintenance. This chapter explores how we balance these demands while integrating the pack seamlessly into the vehicle structure.

## Structural Design Requirements

### Load Cases and Requirements

## Crash Safety Design

### Tesla's Crash Safety Philosophy

**Energy Management Hierarchy:**
- **Avoid**: Prevent crashes through active safety
- **Absorb**: Crush zones dissipate energy before reaching pack
- **Protect**: Pack structure maintains integrity
- **Isolate**: Electrical isolation prevents secondary hazards

### Crash Load Paths

**Frontal Impact**
- **Primary path**: Through vehicle structure around pack
- **Secondary protection**: Pack front reinforcement beam
- **Deformation limits**: <50mm intrusion into pack space
- **Validation**: IIHS small overlap, NHTSA frontal tests

**Side Impact**
- **Challenge**: Limited space for energy absorption
- **Solution**: Thick aluminum side rails with cellular cores
- **Protection**: Side impact beams redirect loads over/under pack
- **Testing**: IIHS side impact, pole impact scenarios

**Rear Impact**
- **Advantage**: More space for crush zones
- **Design**: Graduated stiffness from bumper to pack
- **Protection**: Rear reinforcement beam and mounting brackets
- **Consideration**: Charging port protection

### Rollover Protection

**Design Requirements**
- **Maintain pack integrity**: No major structural deformation
- **Prevent intrusion**: Protect cells from external objects
- **Electrical safety**: Maintain high-voltage isolation
- **Testing**: FMVSS 208 rollover requirements

**Protection Strategies**
- **Strong roof structure**: Distributes loads around pack
- **Pack mounting**: Designed to remain attached during rollover
- **Ground clearance**: Adequate clearance prevents scraping
- **Skid plates**: Protect against rocks and debris

## Mounting and Integration Systems

### Pack-to-Vehicle Mounting

**Mounting Philosophy**
- **Semi-kinematic**: Constrain necessary degrees of freedom
- **Thermal growth**: Allow for expansion/contraction
- **Service access**: Enable pack removal for service
- **Load transfer**: Efficient paths for all load cases

**Mounting Point Design**
- **Number**: 8-12 mounting points typical
