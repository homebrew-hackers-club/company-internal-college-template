## Tesla's Safety Philosophy

Safety is paramount in battery system design. At Tesla, we implement multiple independent layers of protection to ensure that even if one system fails, others will maintain safe operation. Our safety philosophy follows the principle of "defense in depth."

**Safety Hierarchy:**
- **Prevent**: Design out hazards where possible
- **Protect**: Multiple protection layers
- **Mitigate**: Limit consequences of failures
- **Respond**: Emergency response systems
